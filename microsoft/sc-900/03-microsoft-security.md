# Microsoft Defender XDR

Microsoft Defender XDR provides an integrated security operations experience across multiple Microsoft security products.

It can correlate signals from areas such as:

- Endpoints
- Identities
- Email
- Collaboration
- Cloud applications

The goal is to allow analysts to investigate related activity as a connected incident rather than isolated alerts.
